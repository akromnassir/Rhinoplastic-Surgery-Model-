# RhinoplasticModel
This is the conditional generative adversarial network used to predict post-operative facial images after Rhinoplasty. The construction of this model was used with the help of this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004. By using one's own data, converted into a Numpy dataset, this code can be run successfully.
